	<h3>Things I did in June</h3>
	<b>7/12/2021</b>
	<p>During the past month and change, I updated my old site from a Command Prompt-looking site with Bone fonts to a reasonably looking site with Bone fonts, and I have strided to make it more mobile-friendly, though work is still to be done. I've even made very smart decisions on figuring out how to tell if we should load a mobile jQuery set of code, by simply using the CSS property of an empty tag with the class name of "mobile". I have also updated my Skeleton Discord Bot numerous times this past month and change, so many times overall that I honestly couldn't tell what version it's truly at anymore. For this reason alone, the newest version of the Skeleton Discord Bot shall be known as Version X. Any version afterwards will have X in it still. The work on my site and bot are far from complete, as I use both my site here and my bot to keep honing my skills coding-wise.</p>
